- Travel and tourism: Image recognition can be used to recognise certain places or landmarks in a country, which can be useful for travellers and tourists to use while on holiday or on a journey to a foreign place. However, the image recognition system may be unable to recognise all possible known places in the world; for example, it may only be aware of well-known landmarks and cities, and possibly leave tourists confused or lost, making it unreliable.
- Gaming and entertainment: Image recognition can be used to identify a particular video game or show. In some cases, the system may be unable to identify them if they're not well-known or simply not stored in the database.
- Education and learning: Image recognition systems can be used to demonstrate to students how to identify certain objects or cells, or even how to use the system itself for future unrelated usage. However, the system used for image recognition may be initially very expensive for a school to handle.
- Transport and navigation: Again, image recognition can be used to identify specific places and use a map to lead one to their desired destination. Once again, however, there may be a problem if the place that the system is used on is unrecognised, making it unreliable for relatively not well-known places.
- Medicine and healthcare: Image recognition can be used to spot cancer cells, or any other type of cell that may cause disease, during treatment or a biopsy. However, poor lighting or quality may cause the image recognition system to incorrectly identify a cell as something harmful, leading to unsuitable treatment if left unchecked.
