- RACECAR: Check the first and last letters, "R" and "R". Since these are the same, it can be confirmed that the word is at least partially a palindrome, so these letters are crossed off. The process is repeated again with the new first and last letters - "A" and "C" - until one letter is left by itself, the "E". Since it has no other letter left to compare it with, it can be confirmed that the word is a palindrome.
- DEFIED: The same process is repeated with this word. Although the "D"s and "E"s are the same, the middle two letters, "F" and "I", are not the same. Therefore, the word is not a palindrome.
- Any word: In the word, the first and last letters are checked to see if they are the same. If this is the case, they are removed from the word and the new first and last letters and compared again. This process repeats until only one letter is left (in the case of odd-number-lettered words), the last two letters are the same (in the case of even-number-lettered words) or two letters are unable to make a match (in which case, the word is not a palindrome).
